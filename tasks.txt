The last things to do:
==========================================
DONE---1]A list of available profiles. They are deletable.
DONE---2]Creating a profile with of an existing name will just update the existing rather than overwriting it fully
DONE---3]Fixing progressbar for users who have outlived their expectancy
DONE---4]Progressbar should be fixed to the top so that it is always visible
DONE---6]Allow users to attachch a picture image via an URL for every day
DONE---10]Show somewhere in the navbar the name of the currently active profile
DONE---5]Progressbar should include a dropdown with all available years for fast-moving
DONE---8]Validation for submitting an empty daily message == I have decided it is OK to save an empty message
DONE---7]Validation for entering day, month, year
DONE--REFACTORING]Improve the organisation of the code and improve obvious issues







1) Create a flow for profile creations including a password
2) Create a flow for login as an alternative to creation (requires providing a username and password)
3) Show the list of profiles only to an admin
4) Improve general styling of the solution

All in all the solution should be ready for the moment when I build the BE in node.js


Name field typping
- unique and filled -> data.nameValidation = ok
- if data.nameValidation and data.passValidation === ok => enable the next button

Password
- filled and match -> data.passValidation = ok
- if data.nameValidation and data.passValidation === ok => enable the next button
